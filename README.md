# mini-project-4-interactive-visualization-bailey-and-miguel
Bailey Wolfe
Miguel Castillo II

The main idea of our project is a piano keyboard that the user interacts with based on keyboard inputs. The minimum viable product is a few keys that are interactive but hard coded for each key value, as opposed to a list or dictionary lookup system. The stretch goal is being able to change from one octave to another on the keyboard with the arrow keys, and have extra buttons not just piano notes. 
Miguel: Understand the use of classes and how they interact with one another in a larger program.
Bailey: Learn to manipulate classes better and use libraries effectively. 
Sonic Pi, python library for Sonic Pi, pygames, Mingus
We would like to know what classes we will be using, what sound file type and other libraries needed and start the implementation of key shapes (rectangles of a few sizes and colors).
Going down a rabbit hole/in a impossible direction and wasting time. Not knowing what the syntax is and endless debugging
